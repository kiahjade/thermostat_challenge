# Thermostat Challenge

### This was the week 5 challenge at Makers to help us learn JavaScript. My Thermostat uses an API to check the weather in London.

# Specification:

- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with an up function
- You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.

# How to use:

- Clone this repo
- Open index.html in your browser
- Use the relevant buttons
- Power saves mode enables a max temperature of 25 degrees
- There is a min temperature of 10 degrees

# Testing:

- Chrome dev tools
- Jasmine (use the SpecRunner file to access this)
